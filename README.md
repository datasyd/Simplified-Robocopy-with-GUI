# Simplified-Robocopy-with-GUI
PowerShell script with a graphical user interface that activates Robocopy and allows the use of various command-line switches.


I do a lot of work with different computers that have an enormous number of files and very deep folder paths, which Windows normally can’t handle.
For some reason, I was always in doubt and could hardly remember the different command-line switches — and which ones should be used by default when copying files normally.
So I made a PowerShell script that displays Robocopy with a graphical overlay and the most basic switches.

The script must be run with administrator previledges
